# Goal

Create a fully open-source learning resource for young and old.

Giving access to everyone to learn at their own pace and in their own way.
<!-- Too many courses are behind a pay-wall, to only provide limited value. -->

## Project goals

Simplicity is key, the simpler our application, the better.
Instead of focusing on unwanted features and the possibilities of what users would want, it is more important to focus on great UX (user experience) and use that as a growth mechanism.

The website should feel good to the user, meaning:

- fast
- intuitive

Not meaning:

- pretty
