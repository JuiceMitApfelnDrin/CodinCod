# Todo's

## Major

- make libs/types a package that can be imported through npm or alike
- limit amount of validators to 100 or so (not really sure what a good average normal value would be :P)

## Minor

- create a dropdown component for navigation? since they might be useful and would look nice for showing dings in nav
- setup translations
- look into bit and it's relation with pnpm, [see documentation of pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)
- don't override h1, h2, p, ... create classes :)

## Ideas

- make the code field in the puzzle edit form have an actual editor with language support? we already have the editor, just integrate it nicely
