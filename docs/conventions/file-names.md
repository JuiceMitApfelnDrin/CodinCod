# File naming conventions

## Generally

In general try to use the kebab case for files, which means: lowercase letters and `-` where spaces would come, e.g.: `i-am-a-cute-boy`.

## Exceptions

Sometimes there are other rules to adhere to, and exceptions are always a thing!

One such exception is a `README.md` file.

Figure out the other by yourself :+1:
