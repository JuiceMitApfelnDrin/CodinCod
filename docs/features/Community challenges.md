**Challenge Creation by Users**: Allow users to propose and create community challenges for others to participate in. Users can submit challenge descriptions, problem statements, and possible solutions.

**Related Challenges**: Enable foldered challenges, where users can propose follow-up challenges building on the previous one's solutions.

**Moderation and Review**: Introduce a moderation process to review and approve community challenge submissions to ensure quality and relevance. Should also include a feedback mechanism, so the creator knows what to change about the rejected puzzle.

**Prizes and Rewards**: Offer incentives for users who propose particularly engaging or innovative community challenges. Provide digital rewards, platform currency, or special recognition.

**Community Contributions**: Provide an option for users to contribute their own test cases, problem variations, or solutions to existing community challenges.
