## Major

- make libs/types a package that can be imported through npm or alike

## Minor

- create a dropdown component for navigation? since they might be useful and would look nice for showing dings in nav
- setup translations
- look into bit and it's relation with pnpm, [see documentation of pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)
- don't override h1, h2, p, ... create classes :)
