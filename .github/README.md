# Types

## Setup

1. Install dependencies, **only need to run one of these 3**

    ```bash

    # use npm if you don't know what you're doing!
    npm install

    # or for pnpm
    pnpm install

    # or for yarn
    yarn install
    ```

2. Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), build a package:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
