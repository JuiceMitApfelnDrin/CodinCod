# CodinCod

There are several sites on the web like leetcode, codingame, codewars...
But several of them lack essential features people might want in them.

That's why we are here, coming to the rescue, creating an opensource code-puzzle platform where users are at the center!
By definition the users can contribute to this website in many shapes and forms.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- install the LTS (long term service) of [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- an IDE e.g.: [Visual Studio Code (vscode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Experienced Web-developer?

#### run one of these

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuiceMitApfelnDrin/GameCodin.git && cd ./GameCodin
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuiceMitApfelnDrin/GameCodin.git && cd ./GameCodin
yarn && yarn dev
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuiceMitApfelnDrin/GameCodin.git && cd ./GameCodin
npm install && npm run dev
```

### Completely new to Web-development?

#### run this

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuiceMitApfelnDrin/GameCodin.git && cd ./GameCodin && npm install -g pnpm && pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

If it fails, run these lines 1 by 1:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuiceMitApfelnDrin/GameCodin.git
cd ./GameCodin
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

If it still fails contact someone in the discord!
