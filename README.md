# Goal
Creating the best possible website to solve puzzles on.
We achieve this goal when:
- The UI feels intuitive, you should know where to go, even though you never visited the page before, it should feel comfortable.
- The website is performant, no unnecessary bloat-ware, only what's necessary to offer a fun and nice environment.
