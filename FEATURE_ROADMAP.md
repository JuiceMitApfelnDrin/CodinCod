## Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (in order):

1. **Custom Game UI** (1-2 hours)
   - Quick win, backend already done
   - High user value

2. **Private Games** (3-4 hours)
   - Small backend changes
   - Frequently requested feature

3. **Reporting System** (1-2 days)
   - User safety is critical
   - Foundation for healthy community

4. **User Blocking** (3-4 hours)
   - Complements reporting system
   - Low complexity, high UX value

5. **Ranked Matchmaking** (3-5 days)
   - High engagement potential
   - Requires careful testing

### Technical Debt to Address:

- Refactor remaining routes to use service layer
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Add WebSocket reconnection logic
- Create automated tests for game modes

### Architecture Notes:

- **Services First**: Always use service layer for DB operations
- **WebSocket Patterns**: Reuse existing ConnectionManager pattern
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Zod schemas from types library
- **Game Modes**: Use strategy pattern for new competitive modes
- **Lean Code**: Avoid over-engineering, iterate quickly
