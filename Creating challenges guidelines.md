**Assumptions:**

1. **Code of Conduct:** All contributors are expected to adhere to a clear and comprehensive code of conduct that promotes respectful and inclusive behaviour within the platform.
2. **Positive Intent:** Contributors are assumed to have positive intentions, aiming to enhance the learning and collaborative experience for all users.
3. **Privacy Respect:** Contributors respect the privacy settings of other users. Content marked as private are not shared or discussed without explicit permission.
4. **Non-Discrimination:** Contributors will not discriminate or engage in any form of harassment based on factors like race, gender, religion, or skill level.

**Guidelines for Contributors:**

1. **Constructive Feedback:** When providing feedback on solutions, contributors should focus on constructive and helpful suggestions rather than criticism.
2. **Respectful Communication:** Contributors are expected to communicate respectfully and professionally with fellow contributors and users. Disagreements should be handled respectfully.
3. **Encourage Learning:** When discussing solutions, contributors should aim to help users understand concepts and learn from their mistakes, rather than simply providing answers.
4. **No Spoilers:** Contributors should avoid giving away direct solutions or code for ongoing puzzles to encourage active problem-solving.
5. **Inclusive Language:** Use inclusive language that makes all users feel welcome and respected. Avoid jargon that might alienate beginners. Explaining someone at a beginner level makes you smarter than explaining something with a lot of useless jargon.
6. **Check for Accuracy:** When contributing explanations or educational content, ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date.
7. **Ask Before Sharing:** Before sharing another user's solution as an educational example or for discussion, contributors should seek permission from the solution's author.
8. **Respect Diverse Perspectives:** Contributors should acknowledge that there are often multiple valid approaches to solving a problem and respect diverse coding styles.
9. **Guide, Don't Spoil:** When helping users troubleshoot their code, guide them towards finding the solution themselves rather than directly giving them the answer.
10. **Feedback on Guidelines:** Contributors are encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions on the guidelines to continually improve the platform's community culture. Be open to feedback and suggestions from maintainers and other contributors. Address code review comments in a timely manner.
