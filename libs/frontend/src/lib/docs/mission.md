# Goal

Build a fully open-source learning platform that is free and accessible to all, allowing users to learn at their own pace.

## Project Goals

### Simplicity First

A minimal and effective approach ensures a better learning experience. Instead of adding unnecessary features, we prioritize usability and a seamless user journey.

### User Experience Over Design

The platform should **feel good to use**, meaning:

- **Fast** – Quick load times and responsive interactions.
- **Intuitive** – Easy to navigate without needing instructions.

It does **not** mean:

- Overly designed or flashy visuals.

### Truly Free Learning

No paywalls. No hidden costs. Just valuable education available to everyone.
