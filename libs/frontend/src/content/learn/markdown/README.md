# Markdown

Markdown turns simple words and characters into clear, organized text. It's not hard. Below is a cheat-sheet.

Side note: [This whole page is made with markdown, check it out](https://github.com/JuiceMitApfelnDrin/CodinCod/blob/main/libs/frontend/src/content/learn/markdown/README.md)!

## Headings

Use `#` to show title. More `#` means smaller title.

```markdown
# Big Title

## Medium Title

### Small Title
```

## Emphasis

Make words _italic_ or **bold**.

```markdown
_Italic_ and **Bold**
```

## Lists

List things with dashes or numbers.

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
  - Sub-item

1. Step one
2. Step two
```

## Task List

Use checkboxes to track tasks.

```markdown
- [x] Done task
- [ ] Not done task
```

## Links

Turn words into links.

```markdown
[Search](https://www.google.com)
```

## Images

Show picture in text.

```markdown
![Cute Cat](https://example.com/cat.jpg)
```

## Code

Show computer code in one line or block.

For one line:

```markdown
`print("Hello, world!")`
```

For block:

```markdown
\`\`\`

def hello():
print("Hello")

\`\`\`
```

## Blockquotes

Mark quote from someone.

```markdown
> This is a wise word.
```

## Tables

Make grid to organize info.

```markdown
| Name  | Age |
| ----- | --- |
| Alice | 10  |
| Bob   | 12  |
```

## Horizontal Rule

Draw line to break parts.

```markdown
---
```

Markdown simple but powerful. Learn, try, make text awesome.
